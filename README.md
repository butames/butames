- 👋 Hi, I’m Seyram A. Butame
- 👀 I’m interested in data visualization and presentation through coding. I am also interested in data analysis using R/RStudio and STATA.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming in R (and some basic stuff around Python).
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate at the moment, as I do not know what I can collaborate on. However, this may change at a later date.
- 📫 How to reach me -- sbutame@fsu.edu/seyram.butame@med.fsu.ed
